      "description": "This dinner staple straight out of the 1970s has been a reliable recipe used in kitchens everywhere for decades. It’s “Impossibly Easy” because all the ingredients are mixed and baked together, and irresistibly delicious because it’s full of ground beef, cheese and a soft custard-like filling. Make it up to 24 hours ahead of time ahead of time, and keep it in the fridge until you’re ready to bake. It’s a no-fail meal worth putting on repeat.",
